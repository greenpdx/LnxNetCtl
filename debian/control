Description: Async network management tool
 netctl is an async network management tool built on tokio for high
 performance. It provides comprehensive network administration capabilities
 including:
 .
  * Interface management (up/down, IP configuration)
  * WiFi support (scan, connect, regulatory domain)
  * Access point mode with hostapd integration
  * DHCP server configuration with dora
  * DNS management with unbound integration
  * Routing control
  * Bridge and VLAN support
  * VPN support (OpenVPN, WireGuard)
  * NetworkManager D-Bus compatibility
  * Plugin system for extensibility
 .
 netctl can be used as a drop-in replacement for NetworkManager with its
 D-Bus compatibility layer, or as a standalone network management solution.
