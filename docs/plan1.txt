D-Bus Interface Audit Complete ✅

  I've completed a comprehensive audit of the current D-Bus interfaces
  against all CLI commands. Here's what I found:

  Audit Summary (docs/DBUS_INTERFACE_AUDIT.md)

  Currently Implemented (Good Coverage):
  - ✅ Network Control - Core functionality (version, devices, state,
  connectivity)
  - ✅ WiFi Management - Scan, connect, AP mode (mostly complete)
  - ✅ VPN Management - WireGuard, OpenVPN, IPsec, Arti (mostly complete)
  - ✅ Device Interface - Basic device operations

  Critical Gaps Identified (4 Complete Interfaces Missing):
  1. ❌ Connection Management - 12 methods needed (show/add/modify/delete
  connections)
  2. ❌ DHCP Server - 4 methods needed (start/stop/status/leases)
  3. ❌ DNS Server - 5 methods needed (start/stop/status/flush/cache)
  4. ❌ Routing - 5 methods needed (show/add/delete routes)

  Enhancement Needed (Existing Interfaces):
  - ⚠️ Device: Add SetAutoconnect, SetManaged, Delete, GetLLDPNeighbors
  - ⚠️ VPN: Add Import/Export, CreateFromConfig, ListBackends
  - ⚠️ WiFi/AP: Add GetAPStatus, RestartAP, GetAPClients
  - ⚠️ NetworkControl: Add SetLoggingLevel

  Statistics:

  - Total Missing: ~35 new methods + ~15 new signals
  - New Interfaces: 4 complete interfaces
  - Estimated Effort: ~2 weeks for complete coverage

  Implementation Priority:

  Phase 1 (Critical - Week 1):
  1. ✅ Audit complete
  2. Connection management interface (blocking daemon/CLI split)
  3. Device enhancements (SetAutoconnect, SetManaged)

  Phase 2 (Infrastructure - Week 1-2):
  4. DHCP interface
  5. DNS interface
  6. Routing interface

  Phase 3 (Enhancements - Week 2-3):
  7. VPN import/export
  8. WiFi/AP enhancements
  9. Logging control

  The audit document includes detailed method signatures, type definitions,
  and testing requirements for each missing interface.

  Next Steps: Begin implementing the Connection management interface as it's
   critical for the daemon/CLI split to work properly.
